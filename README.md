## ðŸš§ Broken

The website's structure has changed, resulting in breaking this tool. The website now uses a JSON API, so web scraping is no longer necessary, or even easily possible, since it now loads the data dynamically after page load.

Maybe when I have the time, I create a new version of this tool, but for now, it is archived.

---

A small library to parse the publicly available website of timetables for degree
programs of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
abbreviated FB03, at the Hochschule Niederrhein.

## Command line tool

The accompanying command line tool to view timetables directly inside your 
terminal can be found [here](cmd/fbnd).

## FAQ

Why is it called `fbnd`?

- `fbnd` as in `FB03` as in `Fachbereich Null Drei`.

## Note

This is **not** an official tool of the Hochschule Niederrhein.

This is only a personal project of mine that I did, because I wanted to view the
timetable in my terminal.

## License
